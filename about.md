#### Past
I started life as a finance undergrad before going of and getting work
experience in political advisory (UK Parliament) and subsequently management 
consulting. At some point between programming financial models and 
querying campaign databases I realised my next step should be
a postgrad in Computer Science at the University of Bristol.

#### Present

I graduated with a Distinction in 2017 and a few days after my handing
in my thesis started a research position at the University of Bristol.
I currently tinker with tangibles, interactive voice interfaces and AI
to design 'inclusive' educational experiences that benefit children with
visual impairments and otherwise, by bringing them together during collaborative
experiences at school. I also TA at Uni for a few courses at the University spanning intro to 
programming, DB's & Cloud Computing and interactive prototyping.

#### Future

I am  on the lookout for oppurtunities that meld my diverse
work experience in commercial with my technical knowledge in tech.
Feel free to shout at me on twitter, linkedin or just email me !

#### Evidence I am Human

Outside of learning new tech related things, i enjoy reading like a 
crazy person (Douglas Adams and Jonathan Stroud ftw) and perfecting
Pakistanicooking recipies I steal of my grandmother (I make a mean
shrimp biryani)
