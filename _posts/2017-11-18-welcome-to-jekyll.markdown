Hi my name is  `Taimur Ahmed`; a Computer Scientist based at the University of Bristol if you're curious about who I am then refer to the [About][about-section] section of this site
or alternatively reach out to me via my GitHub page or Linkedin.

At the time that i wrote this post, i am 'thinking' about publishing some of the more interesting things i do here. Feel free to subscribe subscribe <a href="/feed.xml">via RSS</a> if you're keen on finding out how that pans out.



Incidentally i built this site using a static site generator called Jekyl. Find out more about it here [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs]
